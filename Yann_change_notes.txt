This is a file that Yann uses to try and keep track of the things that he did. He will now stop speaking in the third person.

18 feb:
- added this file 

23 feb: added sound to the introductory door portal scene
- five granular patches that each have a word of the phrase "a normal human sized door"
- you walk through these sounds to get to the door. they are spatialized
- when you get closer to the door the distance to the door is sent to Pd and used to control the last sound
- I had to change where the player started to accomodate this
