
- a responsive sound system for last room
- also make the stepping stones have variables that step through the sequence, so each stone reproduces the same note
- certainly change the audio device to be default
- Change the stepping stone synth to be more interesting sounding (use the pseudo-fm thing i made in my tutorials)
- make hallway door shatters sound better
- test out that other audio input system, perhaps to improve the echo
